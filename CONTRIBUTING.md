## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `your_package` for local development.

1. Download a copy of `your_package` locally.
2. Install `poetry`
    - `poetry` is changing the way dependencies are managed, so as of July 2022, install `v1.2.0b2` (we will transition to `v1.2.0` once it is released)
    - The command below applies to UNIX systems (Mac/Linux).

        ```console
        $ curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 - --version 1.2.0b2
        ```
        
    - The command below applies to Windows. Run it in PowerShell (make sure you run PowerShell as an administrator).
      - You will also need to add the Poetry bin directory (printed during install) [to your PATH environment variable](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44272416/how-to-add-a-folder-to-path-environment-variable-in-windows-10-with-screensho)
      - For activating environments etc. you may need to alter your [PowerShell Execution Policy to `RemoteSigned`](https://windowsloop.com/change-powershell-execution-policy/)

        ```powershell
          (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | py - --version=1.2.0b2
        ```

4. Install the package using `poetry`:
    - Developers should install additional `poetry` groups for development:
      - `docs` for documentation dependencies
      - `lint` for linters. `your_package` uses `flake8`
      - `test` for testing utilities
      - (optional) `debug` for debugging tools

        ```console
        $ poetry install --with=docs,lint,test
        ```
    - If you are on Windows and attempting to install dependencies results in an error such as the one below, refer to the [fix below](https://github.com/UNSW-CEEM/ceem-python-template/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#fix-for-running-poetry-on-windows):

      ```cmd
      Command "C:\Users\Abi Prakash\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38\python.exe" -W ignore - errored with the following return code 1, and output:
      The system cannot find the path specified.
      C:\Users\Abi Prakash\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38
      input was : import sys

      if hasattr(sys, "real_prefix"):
          print(sys.real_prefix)
      elif hasattr(sys, "base_prefix"):
          print(sys.base_prefix)
      else:
          print(sys.prefix)
      ```

5. Use `git` (or similar) to create a branch for local development and make your changes:

    ```console
    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

6. When you're done making changes, check that your changes conform to any code formatting requirements and pass any tests.

7. Commit your changes and open a pull request.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include additional tests if appropriate.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated.
3. The pull request should work for all currently supported operating systems and versions of Python.

## Fix for running `poetry` on Windows

If you get an error message similar to the one above, or one that returns an `EnvCommandError` when you run `poetry install -vv` follow these steps.

We will implement the fix described [here](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/2746#issuecomment-739439858):

1. Find where `poetry` source files are located. We are interested in `env.py`.

    - They are likely to be here: `C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\pypoetry\venv\Lib\site-packages\poetry\utils`
    - If they are not, run `poetry install -vv` to get a stack trace and find where `env.py` is located (this should be in the stack trace)
2. Find the `_run` method of class `Env`
3. Comment out and add lines as demonstrated below (this is done in the last three line of the code block below)
    
    ```python
    def _run(self, cmd: list[str], **kwargs: Any) -> int | str:
    """
    Run a command inside the Python environment.
    """
    call = kwargs.pop("call", False)
    input_ = kwargs.pop("input_", None)
    env = kwargs.pop("env", dict(os.environ))

    try:
        #if self._is_windows:
        #    kwargs["shell"] = True
        kwargs["shell"] = False
    ```
4. Try `poetry install` again. It should now work.
